# Notification Strategy for Staff Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive notification strategy for the Staff Management System, covering both employee and admin/manager perspectives.

## Notification Types

### 1. Shift-Related Notifications

#### For Employees:
- **New Shift Assigned**: When a manager creates a new shift for them
- **Shift Updated**: When their shift details are modified
- **Shift Cancelled**: When their shift is removed
- **Shift Reminder**: 24 hours before their shift (future enhancement)
- **Shift Conflict**: When overlapping shifts are detected

#### For Managers/Admins:
- **Shift Created**: Confirmation when they create a new shift
- **Shift Updated**: When they modify any shift
- **Shift Cancelled**: When they remove any shift
- **Shift Conflict Alert**: When overlapping shifts are detected for any employee

### 2. Request-Related Notifications

#### For Employees:
- **Swap Request Status**: Approval/rejection of their swap requests
- **Time Off Request Status**: Approval/rejection of their time off requests

#### For Managers/Admins:
- **Pending Swap Request**: New swap request requiring approval
- **Pending Time Off Request**: New time off request requiring approval

### 3. System Notifications

#### For All Users:
- **System Updates**: General system announcements
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Scheduled maintenance notifications

## Notification Display Logic

### Employee View:
- Personal shift notifications
- Request status updates
- System announcements

### Manager/Admin View:
- All employee notifications (for oversight)
- Manager-specific notifications
- System announcements
- Request approval notifications

## Notification Priority Levels

1. **High Priority**: Shift cancellations, conflicts, urgent requests
2. **Medium Priority**: Shift updates, new assignments, request approvals
3. **Normal Priority**: General announcements, confirmations

## Real-Time Updates

- Notifications refresh every 15 seconds
- Immediate updates when actions are performed
- Badge indicators for unread notifications

## Notification Actions

- **View Details**: Navigate to relevant page
- **Mark as Read**: Dismiss individual notifications
- **Mark All as Read**: Bulk dismiss notifications
- **Action Buttons**: Direct links to relevant functions

## Implementation Details

### Notification Creation:
- Automatic creation for all major actions
- Proper user targeting (userId, recipientRole)
- Action URLs for navigation
- Metadata for context

### Notification Storage:
- Persistent storage in JSON files
- Read/unread status tracking
- Timestamp and priority information
- User and role-based filtering

### UI Components:

- Smooth animations and transitions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications**: Browser push notifications for urgent alerts
2. **Email Notifications**: Email alerts for critical updates
3. **SMS Notifications**: Text messages for urgent shift changes
4. **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable notification settings
5. **Notification History**: Extended history and search functionality
6. **Batch Operations**: Bulk notification management for admins
